# Students Performance Analysis
# 📊 Student Performance Analysis Dashboard

This project explores student academic performance using a synthetic dataset. The primary goal is to analyze how demographic and socioeconomic factors influence students’ test scores and pass rates. The final dashboard is built in Power BI and includes interactive visualizations for better insights.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset includes anonymized student-level information such as:

- Gender  
- Race/Ethnicity  
- Parental Level of Education  
- Lunch Type (standard/free-reduced)  
- Test Preparation Course (completed or not)  
- Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing  

A new target variable `passed` was engineered based on the average score, with students passing if their average score is above 60.

## 🎯 Key Insights

- How does test preparation impact passing rates?
- Is there a relationship between parental education and student success?
- Are there differences in performance by gender or ethnicity?

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features

- KPI Cards: Overall pass rate, average score, total students  
- Bar Charts: Average scores grouped by parental education  
- Stacked Columns: Passed/Failed distribution by preparation course  
- Pie Chart: Gender distribution  
- Slicers: Dynamic filters for gender, parental education, test prep
